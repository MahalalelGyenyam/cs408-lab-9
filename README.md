# CS408 - Lab9.2 - Bouncy and EVIL balls!

## Overview

This is a project about experimenting with Javascript in a pre-made environment. The goal is to add in a new element to the "Bouncy Balls" webpage that interacts with the balls in a specified way. Additional features could be added, but the main focuses were the addition of a user controlled "Evil-Ball" and a ball counter in the top-right corner.

## Getting Started

To get started clone this repository and install the "Live server" or "Live Preview" extention.
After that, click the "Start Preview" button that appears on the bottom right side of the VSCode window to launch a new chrome window that will show the "Bouncy Balls" website as intended. If you wish to expand upon what is here, any changes made will be reflected in live time on the webpage (though a page refresh can always be used if needed).

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

To launch the live preview, click the "Start Preview" button that appears on the bottom right side of the VSCode window.

For the development of this webpage about bouncing balls and the scourge of the land known as the Evil Ball, developemnt followed a sort of curve. It was rough trying to understand what was going on at first, especially because there was just so much to look over and understand. After I poked around for a little bit, things started to mkae sense and progress picked up. There was a lot of context clues you could use to guess at what you needed to do based on what the lab was specifying. Adding it to the HTML was where things got confusing again, and I did have to look up how to properly set that up so that the count updated properly. After that was just some bug fixes, things like the ball not hitting a "boundary" at the bottom and right of the screen and the count being off by one. All in all, not that bad of a project, and a fun way to jump into the JS side of things.

## Testing

There are no additional tests made for this website.
